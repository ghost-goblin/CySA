## Intelligence Sources
#### Security Intelligence
+ The process through which data is collected, processed, analyzed, and disseminated to provide insights into the security status of systems, i.e. firewall logs
#### Cyber Threat Intelligence
+ The process of investigating, collecting, analysing, and diseminating threat sources to provide data about the external threat landscape
  - Narrative report
  - Data Feeds
#### CISP (Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership) | ISAC (Information Sharing & Analysis Center)
+ A not-for-profit group set  up to share sector specific threat intelligence and security best practices amongst its members
#### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
+ Methods of obtaining information about a person or organisation  through public records, websites, and social media
#### Proprietary-source intelligence

#### Timeliness

#### Relevancy

#### Accuracy

#### Confidence Levels
