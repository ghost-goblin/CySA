# üëÄ Explain the importance of threat data and intelligence
## Intelligence Sources
#### Security Intelligence
+ The process through which data is collected, processed, analyzed, and disseminated to provide insights into the security status of systems, i.e. firewall logs
#### Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)
+ The process of investigating, collecting, analysing, and diseminating threat sources to provide data about the external threat landscape
  - Narrative report
  - Data Feeds

#### The 3 main objectives of cybersecurity prodessionals is:
| **CIA** Triad       |
|---------------------|
| **C**onfidentiality |
| **I**ntegrity       |
| **A**vailability    |

#### TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)
  + [CISA's (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency)](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts)
  + [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) Framework | [attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org/)
#### CISP (Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership) | ISAC (Information Sharing & Analysis Center)
+ A not-for-profit group set  up to share sector specific threat intelligence and security best practices amongst its members
#### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
+ Methods of obtaining information about a person or organisation through public records, websites, and social media
    + Social Media
    + HTML Code
    + Metadata
#### Proprietary-Source Intelligence
+ Threat intelligence is very widely provided as a commercial service offering, access to research and updates is subject to a subscription fee
#### Closed-Source Intelligence
+ _Honeynet_ data that is derived from the providers oen research and analysis efforts & anonymised information mined from its customers systems

 
#### Pyramid of Pain

1. **Timeliness**
2. **Relevancy**
3. **Accuracy**
4. **Confidence Levels**
    + Property of an intelligence source that ensures it produces qualified statements about reliability 


## Indicator Management
1. Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)
   + JSON for security
     - Observed Data
     - Indicator
     - Attack Patterm
     - Campaign and Threat Actors

```json
  {
    "type": "threat-actor",
    "id": "campaign--8e2e2d2b-17d4-4cbf-938f-98ee46b3cd3f",
    "spec_version": "2.1",

    "name": "Green Group Attacks Against Finance",
    "description": "Campaign by Green Group against targets in the financial services sector."
}
```

2. Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)
   + A **protocol** for supplying codified information to automate incident detection and analysis

   + **Malware Information Sharing Project** (MISP) provides a server platform for cyber threat intelligence sharing, a proprietary format, supports open IOC definitions, and can import and export STIX over TAXII


## Threat Classification
+ Known threat vs. unknown threat
+ Zero-day
   + Usually applied to the vulnerbility itself but can also refer to an attack of malware that exploits it
+ **Advanced Persistent Threat** (APT)
   + An attackers ability to obtain, maintain and diversify access to network systems using exploits and malware
   + Target large **PII data sets**


## Threat Actors
+ Nation-state

       - Sabotage
       - Financial Gain
       - Business Advantage
   - Unintentional
       - Phishing Attack
       - **Shadow IT**
