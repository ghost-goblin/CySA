# üëÄ Explain the importance of threat data and intelligence
## Intelligence Sources
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)
    + The process of investigating, collecting, analysing, and diseminating threat sources to provide data about the external threat landscape

- Nessus
- OpenVAS
- Qualys _(cloud-based SaaS)_
## Software assessment tools and techniques
- Static analysis
   + Source code analysis is done by reviewing the code for an application
- Dynamic analysis
   + Relies on the execution of the code while providing it input to test the softwre
- Reverse engineering
   + Use a compiler to convert the source code into binary (machine) code that the computer can read
   + Use a decompiler to convert the binary code back into source code
- Fuzzing
  + Sending invalid or random data to application to test it's ability to handle unexpected data
## Enumeration
- **Nmap**
   + **Common Platform Enumeration** (CPE) is a scheme for identifying hardware devices, operating systems and applications developed by MITRE
   + By default, Nmap uses a **TCP SYN** scan
   + Nmap supports `HTTP` and `SOCKS 4` proxies, allowing the attacker to configure a remote host as a reverse HTTP proxy and bounce their scans through it or you can use _proxychains_:
      + `proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -n -p445,139,88,80 10.10.226.53`
    + **Target Specification**
       + `nmap 10.129.86.241/24`
    + **Service Version Detection**
       + `nmap -sV 10.129.86.241`
    + **Operating System Detection**
       + `nmap -O 10.129.86.241`
    + **Host Discovery**
       + `nmap -sn 10.129.86.241`
       + _Disable host discovery, port scan only_:
          + `nmap -Pn 10.10.226.53`
    + **Timing & Performance**
       + _Paranoid (0) Intrusion Detection System evasion_:
          + `nmap 10.10.226.53 -T0`
    + **Firewall / IDS Evasion and Spoofing**
       + _Use tiny fragmented IP packets_:
          + `nmap 10.10.226.53 -f`
       + _Relay connections through HTTP/SOCKS4 proxies_:
          + `nmap ‚Äìproxies http://192.168.1.1:8080, http://192.168.1.2:8080 192.168.1.1`
       + _Set offset size_:
          + `nmap 10.10.226.53 ‚Äìmtu 32`
       + _Appends random data to sent packets_:
          + `nmap ‚Äìdata-length 200 10.10.226.53`
    + **Port Scans**
       + `-sS` TCP SYN packet
       + `-sU` UDP Scan
       + `-sT` TCP connect; conducts a three-way handshake scan
       + `-N` Null scan sends a packet with the header bit set to 0
       + `-sF` send an unexpected FIN packet
       + `-sX` sends a packet with the FIN, PSH and URG flags set to 1
       + `-p` Port Range

- hping / hping3
    + TCP/IP packet assembler and analyzer
        + `sudo hping3 -S --flood -p 80 www.wisetut.com`
        + `sudo hping3 -S 192.168.200.15`, send SYN packets to the target IP address
        + `sudo hping3 -0 192.168.200.15`, send a raw IP through the network

- Active vs. passive
    + Active:
       + Pinging hosts
       + Angry IP Scanner
       + Port scanning and service discovery (Nmap)
       + DNS forward or reverse lookup

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Threats and vulnerabilities operating in the cloud
## Cloud service models
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
## Cloud deployment models
- Public
- Private
- Community
- Hybrid
## Function as a Service (FaaS)/ serverless architecture
+ AWS Lambda
+ Google Cloud Functions
+ Microsoft Azure Functions
## Infrastructure as code (IaC)
+ DevOps
+ Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
## Insecure application programming interface (API)
  + Limit exposure of the API keys to the smallest set of individuals possible
  + Use different API keys for differnt user, applications and services
  + Restrict the rights associated with each API key
  + Never transmit API keys over unencrypted channels
  + Never store API key in unencrypted form
  + Ensure API keys are removed from any public code repository like Github
## Improper key management
  + Unauthorised diclosure of a key
  + Non-rotation of keys
  + Inapproriate key storage
## Unprotected storage
## Logging and monitoring
- Insufficient logging and monitoring
- Inability to access









# üå± Implement controls to mitigate attacks and software vulnerabilities
## Attack types
- Extensible markup
 language (XML) attack
- Structured query language (SQL) injection
- Overflow attack
   - Buffer
      + Overflowing a memory location by placing a string longer than a program expects into a variable
      + Enable ASLR (Address Space Location Randomisation) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention) in Windows
   - Integer
   - Heap
      + `malloc()`
- Remote code execution
- üìÅ Directory traversal
    + Insert filesystem path values into a query string
    + `http://10.10.226.146/policy?document='aup.pdf'`
    + Enumerate web server on port 80 with `gobuster`
        ```sh
        gobuster dir -u http://10.10.226.146/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster_scan.txt
        ```
- Privilege escalation
+ Password Reuse:
    - Password spraying
       + Brute-force attacks resulting in thousands or millions of username attempts
    - Credential stuffing
       + Stolen username and password wordlists from another site
- Impersonation
    + OAuth open redirects
- On-path attack (previously known as man-in-the-middle attack)
   + Interfere in the communication flow between two systems
- Session hijacking
  + Session key or cookie exploitation causing the session to pass through a system under the attacker's control
- Rootkit
     + Combined multiple malicious software tools to provide continued access to a system while hiding their own existence
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
     + An attacker embeds scripting commands on the website which can be executed by an unsuspecting user
     ```js
     // Inside of input field the following command will help find XSS by creating a simple alert
     <script>alert(1)</script>
     ```
     + Add the payload in the URL
     ```sh
     # Exploiting a vulnerable URL parameter and alerting the users cookie
     http://10.10.226.56/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
     ```
     + Enable **Output Encoding** to prevent this type of attack
        + Translates special characters so that it won't be interpreted as part of the script
 - Reflected
     + The attacker tricks the user in sending the attack to the server disguised as a ligitimate query string or other content
     + The server sends (reflects) the attack back to the user, causing it to execute
 - Persistent
     + The attacker is able to store the attack code on a server, waiting for the user to request the infected content
 - Document object model (DOM)
     + see _JavaScript_
     + Attacks occur within a database maintained by the user's web browser
## Vulnerabilities
- Improper error handling
- Dereferencing
- Insecure object reference
- Race condition
   + Rely on timing
- Broken authentication
- Sensitive data exposure
- Insecure components
- Insufficient logging and monitoring
- Weak or default configurations
    + A vulnerable FTP server which allows anonymous access:
      ```sh
      User:  anonymous
      Password:  anonymous@domain.com
      ```
- Use of insecure functions
 - strcpy
    + Used to copy the source string to the destination string
    + A stack overflow is caused if the buffer size of the destination string is smaller than the size of the source string
