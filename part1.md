## Intelligence Sources
#### Security Intelligence
+ The process through which data is collected, processed, analyzed, and disseminated to provide insights into the security status of systems, i.e. firewall logs
#### Cyber Threat Intelligence
+ The process of investigating, collecting, analysing, and diseminating threat sources to provide data about the external threat landscape
  - Narrative report
  - Data Feeds
#### CISP (Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership) | ISAC (Information Sharing & Analysis Center)
+ A not-for-profit group set  up to share sector specific threat intelligence and security best practices amongst its members
#### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
+ Methods of obtaining information about a person or organisation  through public records, websites, and social media
#### Proprietary-source intelligence
+ Threat intelligence is very widely provided as a commercial service offering, access to research and updates is subject to a subscription fee
#### Closed-source intelligence
+ Honeynet data that is derived from the providers oen research and analysis efforts & anonymised information mined from its customers systems

1. Timeliness
2. Relevancy
3. Accuracy
4. Confidence Levels
    + Property of an intelligence source that ensures it produces qualified statements about reliability 


## Indicator management
1. Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)
  + XML for security
2. Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)
3. OpenIoC

## Threat classification
+ Known threat vs. unknown threat
+ Zero-day
   + Usually applied to the vulnerbility itself but can also refer to an attack of malware that exploits it
+ **Advanced Persistent Threat** (APT)
   + An attackers ability to obtain, maintain and diversify access to network systems using exploits and malware

## Threat actors
+ Nation-state
+ Hacktivist
+ Organized crime
+ Insider threat
   - Intentional
       - Sabotage
       - Financial Gain
       - Business Advantage
   - Unintentional
       - Phishing Attack
       - **Shadow IT**
 
## Intelligence Cycle
+ `Requirements` (Direction & Planning) > `Collection & Processing` > `Analysis` > `Dissemination` > `Feedback` >

## Information sharing and analysis communities
+ Healthcare
+ Financial
+ Aviation
+ Government
+ Critical infrastructure
