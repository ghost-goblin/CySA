# 🔥 Incident Response
[<<<](part3.md) | [>>>](part5.md)

 </div>

# 🎨 Incident response process
## Communication plan
- Limiting communication to trusted parties
- Disclosing based on regulatory/ legislative requirements
- Preventing inadvertent release of information
- Using a secure method of communication
- Reporting requirements
## Response coordination with relevant entities
- Legal
- Human resources
- Public relations
- Internal and external
- Law enforcement
- Senior leadership
- Regulatory bodies
## Factors contributing to data criticality
- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Personal health information (PHI)
- Sensitive personal information (SPI)
- High value asset
- Financial information
- Intellectual property
- Corporate information

# 🖌️ Apply the appropriate incident response procedure

# 🔬 Analyze potential indicators of compromise (IOCs)
## Network-related
- Bandwidth consumption
- Beaconing
- Irregular peer-to-peer communication
- Rogue device on the network
- Scan/sweep
- Unusual traffic spike
- Common protocol over non-standard port
## Host-related
- Processor consumption
- Memory consumption
- Drive capacity consumption
- Unauthorized software
- Malicious process
- Unauthorized change
- Unauthorized privilege
- Data exfiltration
- Abnormal OS process behavior
- File system change or anomaly
- Registry change or anomaly
- Unauthorized scheduled task
## Application-related
- Anomalous activity
- Introduction of new accounts
- Unexpected output
- Unexpected outbound communication
- Service interruption
- Application log


# 🧪 Utilize basic digital forensics techniques
# Network
- Wireshark
    + Display filters
    ```sh
     tcp.port eq 25 or icmp
     ip.src == 152.106.6.125 and ip.dst == 192.168.0.1
     reg query HKLM\Software /v QuietUninstallString /s | find "Wireshark"
    ```
- tcpdump

```sh
tcpdump -e   # option includes the ethernet header during packet capture
tcpdump -n   # flag will show the IP addresses in numeric form
tcpdump -nn  # option shows IP addresses and ports in numeric format
tcpdump -X   # option will capture the packet's payload in hex and ASCII formats.
```

## Endpoint
- Disk
- Memory
## Mobile
## Cloud
## Virtualization
## Legal hold
## Procedures
## Hashing
- Changes to binaries
## Carving
## Data acquisition
+ CPU registers and cache memory
+ Contects of system memory (RAM), routing tables, ARP cache, process table, temporay swap files
+ Data on persistent mass storage (HSS/SDD/flash drive)
+ Remore logging and monitoring data
+ Physical configuration and network topology
+ Archival media

> While most of the Windows registry is stored on the disk, some keys (like `HKLM\Hardware`) are only stored in memory, so you should analyse the Registry via a memory dump
