# Analyze data as part of security monitoring activities


## Heuristics
## Trend analysis
## Endpoint
- Malware
     - Reverse engineering
- Memory
- System and application behavior
     - Known-good behavior
     - Anomalous behavior
     - Exploit techniques
- File system
- User and entity behavior
 analytics (UEBA)
## Network
- Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and
 domain name system (DNS) analysis
     - Domain generation algorithm
- Flow analysis
- Packet and protocol analysis
 - Malware
## Log review
- Event logs
- Syslog
- Firewall logs
- Web application firewall (WAF)
- Proxy

## Impact analysis
- Organization impact vs. localized impact

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) review
- Rule writing
- Known-bad Internet protocol (IP)
- Dashboard
+ Host-centric log sources
    + Log removal
       - WinEventLog EventID `104`
           - `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable @{LogName='System';ID='104'}`
       - Codes `104` or `1102` indicate that the event log was cleared
       - Event code `1100` indicates an event log service shutdown
    + A user accessing a file
    + A user attempting to authenticate
    + Editing a registry key or value
    + PowerShell execution
+ Network-centric Lod
    + SSH
