## Endpoint
- Malware
     - **Reverse engineering** is the process of analysing the structure of hardware or software to reveal more about how it functions
     + Masquerading
     + DLL Injection
        + Manipulates the execution of a running process to load a desired library
           + `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs`
           + `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCertDLLs` are loaded into every process that call the Win32 API functions
           + `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs` are loaded into every process that runs `User32.dll`
     + DLL sideloading
        + [Hijack Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)
        + Planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes the payload that tricks the application into loading a malicious DLL
     + Process hollowing
        + [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/)
        + Inject malicious code into a suspended or hollowed process to evade process-based defenses
     + **Dropper** Malware is designed to install or run other types of malware embedded in a payload on an infected host
     + **Downloader** is a piece of code that connects to the Internet to retrieve additional tools after the initial infection by a dropper
     + Shellcode is any lightweight code designed to run an exploit on the target, which may include any type of code format from scripting to binary code
   + [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/):

      + Check out [Intro to Endpoint Security](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoendpointsecurity) Room on TryHackMe
      + System Idle `PID 0` and System `PID4` a kernel-level binary that is the parent of the first user-mode process (Session Manager Subsystem - `smss.exe`)
      + `csrss.exe` (Client Server Runtime SubSystem) manages low-level Windows functions, running from `%SystemRoot%\System32` and has no parent process
      + `wininit.exe` managed driver and services and should only have a single instance running as a process
      + `Services.exe` hosts nonboot drivers and background services, one instance running as a child of `winit.exe`, and other processes showing a child of `services.exe` or `svchost.exe`
         + Services will be started by `SYSTEM`, `LOCAL SERVICE` or `NETWORK SERVICE` accounts (if it is started by a `username`, it should be flagged)
      + `lsass.exe` (Local Security Authority SubSystem) handles authentication and authorisation services, single instance running as a child of `wininit.exe`
      + `winlogon.exe` managed access to the user desktop for each user session with Desktop Window Manager (`dwm.exe`) as a child process
      + `userinit.exe` sets up the shell (`explorer.exe`) and then quits
      + `explorer.exe` is the typical user shell launched with the user's account privileges and is the parent process for the logged-on user
   - Anomalous behavior
      1. Any process name that you do not recognise; `cmd.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, `wmic.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `reg.exe`, `sc.exe`

              ```   

## Network
- Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and domain name system (DNS) analysis
   + **Percent encoding** allows a user-agaent to submit any safe or unsafe character (or binary data) to the server within the URL (encodeing unreserved characters)
      + Percent encoding can be misused to obfuscate the nature of a URL and submit input as a script or binary to perform directory transversal
   - **Fast Flux Network** is a method used by malware to hide the presence of C&C networks by continually changing the host IP addresses in domain records using _Domain Generation Algorithms_
   - **Domain Generation Algorithm** (DGA) used by malware to evade blacklists by generating domain names for C&C networks dynamically
   - **Fast Flux DNS** is a technique that rapidly changed the IP address with the associated domain
   - **Port Hopping** - An APT's C2 application might use any port to communicate and may jump betweeen different ports
- Flow analysis
   + **Flow collector** is a means of recording **metadata** and statistics about network traffic rather than recording each frame
   + Router-based monitoring:
     + NetFlow standard
     + RMON
     + SNMP
    + PRTG:
      + Packet sniffing which monitors the headers of packets
      + Flows
      + SNMP
      + WMI
- Packet and protocol analysis
 - Malware
     1. Attacker sets up one or more dynamic DNS services
     2. Malware code implements a DGA to create a list of new domain names
     3. A parallel DGA is used to create name records on the DDNS service
     4. The malware tries a selection of the domains it has created to connect to the C2 server
     5. C&C server communicates with a new seed for the DGA to prevent from being blocked
