# üëÆ Apply security solutions for infrastructure management
## Cloud vs. on-premises
## Asset management
- Asset tagging
  + Labeling or otherwise identifying systems, devices and other items
## Segmentation
- Physical
- Virtual
   + Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
- Jumpbox
   + Can span 2 different security zones
   + Access into segmented networks from different security zones through a VPN
- System isolation
 - Air gap
   + Ensures that there is no connection at all between the infrastructures
## Network architecture
- Physical
- Software-defined
- Virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Virtual private network (VPN)
- Serverless
## Change management (CAB)
## Virtualization
- Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)
## Containerization
+ A technology that bundles together an application and their files, libraries and other dependencies, allowing the application to be deployed to multiple platforms or systems
## Identity and access management (IAM)
- Privilege management
   + Part of Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework
   + Identity and Access Management systems are built to create, store and manage permissions, groups and other information
   + Active Directory
       + Enabling and requiring TLS to keep LDAP queries and authentication secure which helps protect data in transit
       + Setting password storage to use a secure method
       + LDAP v2 defines three types of authentication: anonymous, simple (clear-text password) and Kerberos v4
       + LDAP ACLs can limit which accounts or users can access objects in the directory
       + Kerberos _(unlike RADIUS and TACACS+)_ is designed to operate on untrusted networks and uses encryption to protect its authentication traffic
           + [LDAP Injection](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) is used to improperly filter user input via web applications to send arbitary LDAP queries
   + **RADIUS**
   + **TACACS+**
       + TACACS+ should be run in an isolated environment to protect it from attackers
   + OAuth redirect exploits are a form of impersonation attack, allowing the attacker to pretend to be a legimate user
- Multifactor authentication (MFA)
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Federation
   + Identity Providers (IDPs)
- Role-based (RBAC)
   + Subjects can only use permission if they have a role
   + The subject's role must be authorised for them to have
   + Subjects can use permissions only if the subject's role is authorised to use it
   + **Privilege Creep** occurs when a user changes roles but their permissions are not updated with their new respnsibilities
- Attribute-based (ABAC)
   + Based on policies
- Mandatory (MAC)
- Manual review
## Cloud access security broker (CASB)
+ Provide an additonal protection layer for accessing cloud-based applications
   + API-based CASB
   + Inline CASB solutions require either the **network configuration** or the use of a **software agent** to intercept requests from the users to the cloud provider to monitor and enforce policies
## Honeypot
## Monitoring and logging

## Encryption
+ Encryption at rest used at the host layer
+ Security keys and passwords must be secured
+ Hashing required to maintain integrity


## Certificate management

## Active defense
