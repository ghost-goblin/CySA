# üëÆ Apply security solutions for infrastructure management
## Cloud vs. on-premises
## Asset management
- Asset tagging
## Segmentation
- Physical
- Virtual
   + Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
- Jumpbox
   + Can span 2 different security zones
   + Access into segmented networks from different security zones through a VPN
- System isolation
 - Air gap
   + Ensures that there is no connection at all between the infrastructures
## Network architecture
- Physical
- Software-defined
- Virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Virtual private network (VPN)
- Serverless
## Change management (CAB)
## Virtualization
- Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)
## Containerization
## Identity and access management
- Privilege management
- Multifactor authentication (MFA)
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Federation
- Role-based
- Attribute-based
- Mandatory
- Manual review
## Cloud access security broker (CASB)
## Honeypot
## Monitoring and logging

## Encryption
+ Data at rest
+ Security keys and passwords must be secured
+ Hashing required to maintain integrity


## Certificate management

## Active defense
